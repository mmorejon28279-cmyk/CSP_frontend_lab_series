// TODO 1: Print your full name with console.log()
console.log ("Matthew Morejon")

// TODO 2: Declare variable favoriteFood, assign "Steak", then reassign "Pizza"
let favoriteFood = "Steak";
console.log (favoriteFood)

favoriteFood = "Pizza";
console.log (favoriteFood)
// TODO 3: Create variable mystery, assign a string, then a number, print type each time
let mystery; 
 
mystery = "football"; 
console.log("Value: ",mystery," Type: ", typeof mystery); 
 
mystery = 20; 
console.log("Value: ",mystery," Type: ", typeof mystery); 
 
// TODO 4: Declare const schoolName, try to reassign
const schoolName = "Columbus";
console.log (schoolName)

// TODO 5: Create three valid camelCase variables and print them
let thisWayIsCalledCamelCase = "Day Of Week";
console.log("value: ",thisWayIsCalledCamelCase, "Type: ", typeof thisWayIsCalledCamelCase)

thisWayIsCalledCamelCase = "Day Of month";
console.log("value: ",thisWayIsCalledCamelCase, "Type: ", typeof thisWayIsCalledCamelCase)

thisWayIsCalledCamelCase = "Day Of Year";
console.log("value: ",thisWayIsCalledCamelCase, "Type: ", typeof thisWayIsCalledCamelCase)
// 🚀 Stretch Goals (optional)
// - Create a variable age and print "I am X years old" using concatenation
// - Repeat using template literals

   1. What new concept or skill did you learn in this lab?
<<<<<<< HEAD
   I learned how to use console.log and create variables
   2. How did you apply logic or conditionals in your code?
   I applied Logic by using common sense to understand that const stood for constant and it cant change.
   3. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?
   One challenge i encountered was not understanding some terms like camelCase and i solved it by rereading the PDF.
   4. Where else could this programming concept be useful?
   This could be useful when designing a professional website.
